Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company that will be provided as data set called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/momoe711/Py-Me-Up-Charlie/tree/master/PyBank/Resources). 

The Python script will analyze the financial records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

*[Financial Analysis](https://github.com/momoe711/Py-Me-Up-Charlie/blob/master/PyBank/financial_analysis.txt) is below:

  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2288
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2017 ($1170593)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2017 ($-1196225)

Create a Python script to analyze and modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/momoe711/Py-Me-Up-Charlie/tree/master/PyPoll/Resources). 

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote

Create a Python script to convert your employee records to the required format. 

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
  * The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
  * The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
  * The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

```text
  Employee_ID,First_Name,Last_Name,DOB,SSN,State

Create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics.

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * Approximate word count
  * Approximate sentence count
  * Approximate letter count (per word)
  * Average sentence length (in words)

*[Paragraph Analysis](https://github.com/momoe711/Py-Me-Up-Charlie/blob/master/PyParagraph/paragraph_1_analysis.txt) is below: 
```text
Paragraph Analysis
---------------------------
Approximate Word Count:130
Approximate Sentence Count:5
Average Letter Count:7.4
Average Sentence Length:26.0

Paragraph Analysis
---------------------------
Approximate Word Count:285
Approximate Sentence Count:11
Average Letter Count:6.3
Average Sentence Length:25.91
```

## Considerations

  * Import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats
  * Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
  * Iterate through basic data structures
  * Git commit
