## Background

![](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Poll-Analysis/image/Vote_counting.jpg)

## Objectives
Create a Python script to analyze and modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Poll-Analysis/resources/election_data.csv). 

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
  
## Results
*[Election Analysis](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Poll-Analysis/election_analysis.txt) is below:

## Considerations

  * Import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats
  * Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
  * Iterate through basic data structures
  * Git commit
