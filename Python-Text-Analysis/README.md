## Background

![](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Text-Analysis/image/language.jpg)

## Objectives
Create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics.

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * Approximate word count
  * Approximate sentence count
  * Approximate letter count (per word)
  * Average sentence length (in words)

## Results
*[Paragraph Analysis 1](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Text-Analysis/paragraph_1_analysis.txt) 
 and [Paragraph Analysis 2](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Text-Analysis/paragraph_2_analysis.txt) are below: 
```text
Paragraph Analysis
---------------------------
Approximate Word Count:130
Approximate Sentence Count:5
Average Letter Count:7.4
Average Sentence Length:26.0

Paragraph Analysis
---------------------------
Approximate Word Count:285
Approximate Sentence Count:11
Average Letter Count:6.3
Average Sentence Length:25.91
```
## Considerations

  * Import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats
  * Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
  * Iterate through basic data structures
  * Git commit
