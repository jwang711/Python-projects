## Background & Objectives

![]https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Employee-Analysis/images/boss.jpg)

Create a Python script to convert your employee records to the required format. 

The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:
  * The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
  * The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
  * The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
  * The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

### Results

*[Employee Analysis](https://github.com/momoe711/Py-Me-Up-Charlie/blob/master/PyBoss/employee_data_finished.csv) is below: 
```text
  Employee_ID,First_Name,Last_Name,DOB,SSN,State
  232,John,Mathews,24/02/1991,***-**-9165,ND
  533,Nathan,Moore,19/11/1978,***-**-7469,ME
  256,Amanda,Douglas,08/01/1990,***-**-6961,ID
  189,Heather,Andrews,11/08/1976,***-**-1797,VT
  284,Daniel,Hernandez,22/07/1976,***-**-7473,CO
  ```
### Considerations

  * Import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats
  * Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
  * Iterate through basic data structures
  * Git commit
