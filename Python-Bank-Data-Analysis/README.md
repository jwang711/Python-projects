## PyBank

### Background

![](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Bank-Data-Analysis/image/revenue-per-lead.jpg)

Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company that will be provided as data set called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Bank-Data-Analysis/resources/budget_data.csv). 

### Objectives

The Python script will analyze the financial records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

### Results

*[Financial Analysis](https://github.com/jwang711/python-projects/blob/master/Python-Bank-Data-Analysis/financial_analysis.txt) is below: 
```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2288
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2017 ($1170593)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2017 ($-1196225)
  ```
### Considerations

  * Import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats
  * Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
  * Iterate through basic data structures
  * Git commit
